# 1. Introduction
The project presented here is a 2D platformer video game inspired by iconic titles such as "Blasphemous" and "Hollow Knight," as well as the movie "Van Helsing." The game features a protagonist, a knight with blue details, who battles various creatures and overcomes obstacles in carefully designed, minimalist levels. It offers an immersive experience combining elements of action, adventure, and challenging gameplay.

# 2. Origin and Project Contextualization
The idea for this project stemmed from my nostalgia for my first video game, "New Super Mario Bros," and a fascination with the dark, atmospheric narratives present in "Blasphemous" and "Hollow Knight." The goal was to create a game that not only challenged the player's skills but also provided a visually and auditorily enriching experience. Additionally, inspiration was drawn from the gothic aesthetics and supernatural elements of the movie "Van Helsing" to set the scenes and design the characters, providing a rich, immersive backdrop that complements the gameplay. An example of the immersive ambiance of the video game is its music, a blend of 8-bit and electronic elements.

# 3. General Project Objective
To develop a 2D platformer video game that offers a challenging and atmospheric gaming experience, combining combat and exploration mechanics with an artistic design inspired by gothic works and dark narratives, while maintaining a minimalist and colorful design of enemies.

# 4. Specific Objectives
Design and Develop a Unique Protagonist: Create a knight with blue details who possesses special abilities such as double jump and melee attacks.
Implement Enemies and Behaviors: Develop enemies with varied behaviors, such as the slime that follows the player, to increase difficulty, the mushroom that remains stationary, and the skull that moves on the "y" axis.
Create a Level System: Design thematic levels, such as a forest full of monsters and a ruined castle with moving platforms, each with its own challenges and unique bosses.
Develop Bosses with Health Bars: Include bosses in each level with unique combat mechanics and a visible health bar for the player, providing an additional challenge. The two bosses, one that increases speed as it takes damage and the other with smoother animations and slightly more difficulty.
Establish an Animation and Movement System: Implement fluid animations for the protagonist, enemies, and environmental elements from pixels, ensuring an attractive visual experience.
Set up a Background System: Implement animations and optical illusions of depth using the parallax effect.
Create a Menu and Game Management System: Develop a functional start menu, as well as a Game Manager that controls essential aspects of the game such as level progression, player life, and enemy management. Or a script to manage player combat.
Optimize Gameplay and User Experience: Conduct continuous testing to ensure smooth gameplay and satisfactory user experience, making adjustments based on feedback received.
